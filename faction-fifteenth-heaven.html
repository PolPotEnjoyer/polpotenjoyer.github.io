                <h1>Cult of the Fifteenth Heaven</h1>
                <p>
                    <b>The Cult of the Fifteenth Heaven</b> is a relatively new religious movement that sprang up during the early settlement of
                    <a href="geography-plain.html">Quantrill's Plain</a>. The name refers to the cult's belief in fifteen heavens: one each for the fourteen Craters - the Lower Heavens, and a Heaven Ascendant
                    which can only be reached by those who have attained enlightenment. Characterized by a distrust for outsiders and the traditional social
                    systems and hierarchies of the Craters, Fifteenth Heaveners are most often found in a scattered network of hidden monasteries across the Plain, though they also
                    dominate the politics of <a href="geography-zapels-town.html">Zapel's Town</a>, which they both founded and have their own district in, making up around half the population. They also hold a small quarter
                    in <a href="geography-rondesvous.html">Rondezvous</a> and a few individuals are likely to be found somewhere in <a href="geography-quantrill-city.html">Quantrill City</a>.

                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>
                    The origins of the Fifteenth Heavener Cult, including the exact date of their foundation, are shrouded in mystery. According to themselves - the only real source available - 
                    their founder was a mysterious <a href="geography-hameghavat-crater.html">Hamen</a> woman known as Zapel the Illuminator. Following the story, Zapel was a blind widow of humble means
                    who regained her sight through the use of Sansite, when all other means had failed. This minor miracle set her on a long quest for the truth, and the full potential of Sansite to bring
                    about more and greater miracles, a journey towards enlightenment and ascension. When the First Sansite Rush began, Zapel was one of the first generation of permanent settlers, quickly gathering
                    a following among prospectors both hopeful and bankrupt. Together they founded a then-isolated community in the Plain's far Northwest, which later came to be named after her. Zapel disappears
                    from all record after a few years, presumed dead. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As mining operations continued to expand and the <a href="faction-quantrill-company.html">Quantrill-Calumet Mining Company</a> became yet more powerful, the cult's isolation was threatened.
                    Prospectors inevitably began to settle around Zapel's Town, and though efforts were made to evict them the outnumbered Fifteenth-Heaveners were eventually forced to allow them to settle in a seperate quarter.
                    This loss of isolation motivated the growth of the cult's diaspora across the Plain, with a small, well-hidden monastery network emerging to echo the Company's stations. Today, the cult of the
                    Fifteenth Heaven forms a major, if somewhat passive, force in Upland Politics and appears to continue to grow, though their secretive nature evades reliable inspection.
