                <h1>Quantrill-Calumet Mining Company</h1>
                <p>
                    <b>The Quantrill-Calumet Mining Company</b> is a primarily-Human worldwide logistics company specialising in the mining and refining of Sansite ore,
                    primarily extracted from Quantrill's Plain. It also has significant interests in shipping, salt mining, shipbuilding, toolmaking, and, in some areas,
                    even serves as law enforcement. While it is called a "Mining Company", this name is something of a misnomer as the company's primary business model in fact relies on 
                    third-party prospectors to mine the Sansite, instead deriving its wealth from supplying these prospectors at various supply stations scattered across the uplands, especially
                    on The Plain. Therefore, it would perhaps be more appropriately called a logistics company, though their habit of taking payment in ore and near-monopoly on refining facilities
                    in several key markets causes them to simultaneously be the main supplier of both raw and finished Sansite as well.
