                <p>
                    Welcome aboard this standard Quantrill-Calumet Mining Company river barge, designed for the utomst efficiency in transporting its cargo,
                    AND YOU to the heart of this fine region! My name is Gaiseric and I will be your captain for this journey down this wonderful Fortune River, all the way down to the famous Quantrill City.
                    On the way, we will be calling in at stations Diligence and Perseverance, and you can drop in there for some quick shopping or human contact. Do be aware that the Company does charge
                    for any goods and services consumed at the station, and we accept gold, sansite or credit of either as payment. We strongly encourage all travellers to register with us and become
                    Associates, joining the greater Quantrill Fellowship. Joining has a lot of benefits for YOU, dear passengers, especially those of you - I suspect this applies to most of you - 
                    who are looking to go prospecting this Summer. This means such great things as REDUCED TOLLS, MONSTER DAMAGE INSURANCE, and even INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES, in the 
                    biggest and best company in the WHOLE WORLD. You don't want to have your ship destroyed out in the wilderness with nothing to show for it, would you? I definitely would not even consider risking it!
                </p>
                <p>
                    OF COURSE, we do have a few caveats to membership. The Company reserves the right to take necessary disciplinary action against any Associate who is proven
                    to be taking hostile action against us, including membership revocation or necessary defensive measures. That includes membership in any organization whose objectives are manifestly
                    opposed to Company Policy, as set by Director Quantrill and the Regional Administrator, the vandalism of Company Property, or seditiously bringing The Company into disrepute. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think that's about the whole preamble. Most likely we'll reach Fort Diligence in about 6 days, and Quantrill City in maybe a bit under a month. Be prepared for a bump when we reach a place;
                    these barges run off the flow of the river, and the chain across stops us getting stranded out on Lake Bitter once we reach our destination. Apart from that you should learn to
                    entertain yourself on these long journeys, it's a way of life up here, and if you don't do it your life is going to SUCK. And here at Quantrill-Calumet, the public good is our greatest
                    concern, therefore we wholeheartedly desire your success and prosperity!
                </p>
